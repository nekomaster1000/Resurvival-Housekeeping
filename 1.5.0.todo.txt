= TO DO =
"Recipes: Being able to upgrade stone-> diamond tools the same way you upgrade wood to stone, tool in one slot and the amount of materials needed to upgrade in the other slots

Enderian origin's ender pearl cooldown should be much longer (you can cross large distances with it easily, 10-20 second cooldown maybe?)

Terralith structure loot tables either heavily edited or flat out removed, plus some biomes (ie yellowstone biome) should be removed cuz you can easily progress in some mods (tetra) very quickly with it, a terralith structure has fuckin end rods, VERY GOOD FOR TETRA TOOLS BTW

Feline origin could be nerfed a bit, maybe some creepers could randomly spawn that aren't afraid of the origin (the player not other cats), it would still make them a threat but not as big of one"


JEI blacklisting? hello??
