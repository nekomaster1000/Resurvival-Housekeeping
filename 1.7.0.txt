- Added Combat Music - If at least 5 mobs are attacking at once, battle music will play! Client side and totally configurable.
- Added Combat Roll - Bound to LEFT SHIFT so you can easily press it whilst moving in any direction
- Added Not Enough Crashes - Better, hopefully more useful crash reports!
- Disabled the Totem of Holding from Quark Oddities (Corpse already does what it does, arguably better)
- Removed the Totem of Undying from Aquamirae's Frozen Chest loot table.
- Gave the Ghost of Captain Cornelia double her normal health.
- Made it so EnhancedAI Miner Zombies can only mine up to Y32 so they don't mine into your base and/or prevent you from sleeping
- Made the rainbow XP bar and new terracotta textures optional, off by default
