Resurvival: Vitals
A Lite version of Resurvival for those who don't intend to fully sink their teeth into the quests, care for all the building blocks, or mind a more barren End dimension. 
Specifically, it's made for those who still want to enjoy the pack, but can't handle it at it's full size just because of how absolutely collosally large it is.
Whilst lacking the full range of mobs, foods and polishes, Vitals still contains the core components that make Resurvival what it is at heart, allowing you to enjoy it without having to buy another two RAM sticks!
