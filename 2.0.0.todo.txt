= DONE = 
- Heavily Nerfed Copper's spawn rate. Look for it in Dripstone caves for better chances.
- Gave the Avian origin the Master of the Skies power (Shoot up into the air - Active ability)

= TO DO =
- Test improved Blazeborn air speed with the Dart power
- Test Arachnid Web Attack power
- Test new Weak Swimmer changes (longer weakness and additional slowness)

- Add Credits button in-game via Fancymenu

- Remove Terralith (Thus fixing the problem of its structures giving you Tetra tool materials too early)
- Add Biome Makeover
- Add Integrated Dungeons and Structures
- Add End's Phantasm (And maybe remove Plus the End?)

- Maybe remove Savage Ender Dragon if it doesn't add much to the fight?

- FTBQuests progression chain, locking Eyes of Ender behind boss fights (Biome Makeover, Mowzies Mobs, Aquamirae, Piglin Brute)
- Remove Diamonds from the underground ALMOST entirely, making them far more discoverable through loot and boss fights
