- Remove Terralith (Thus fixing the problem of its structures giving you Tetra tool materials too early)
- Add Biome Makeover
- Add Integrated Dungeons and Structures
- Add End's Phantasm (And maybe remove Plus the End?)

- FTBQuests progression chain, locking Eyes of Ender behind boss fights (Biome Makeover, Mowzies Mobs, Aquamirae, Piglin Brute)
- Remove Diamonds from the underground ALMOST entirely, making them far more discoverable through loot and boss fights
