- Added Spells and Shields, a vanilla-styled magic mod! 
Powers are bound to the numpad keys by default - 
7 for Slot 1, 
4 for Slot 2, 
1 for Slot 3, 
2 for Slot 4, 
and 3 for Slot 5
- Updated Immersive Weathering - This one's big for all you England fans!

- Blazeborn now always starts their spawn in a Warped Forest

- Updated the Champions loot table via datapack so that Champions drop Enchanting Gems and various other useful items as opposed to Enchanted Books, 
which are far too bountiful in the pack already. Makes for a really handy way to obtain the rarer gems like Lucky Citrine and Haste Peridot!

- Lowered Hasty Champion Affix's speed bonus to 1.5
- Enhabled Plagued and Desecration Affixes for Champions
- Reduced Plagued and Desecration's area of effect clouds to 0.5 and 1 from 4 and 5 respectively

- Gave Glowsilk Bow a new sprite for consistency with the Air Malachite Bow and Neko's Enhanced Tools and Armour
- Gave Air Malachite Bow a new look, Forging recipe, and Curse of Vanishing. (It's currently unbreakable, so this is the compromise)

- Added Retextures o' Plenty resource pack by IcyCrystal! Thanks dude!
