= DONE =
- Updated Immersive Weathering - This one's big for all you England fans!
- Blazeborn now always starts their spawn in a Warped Forest

- Updated the Champions loot table via datapack so that Champions drop Enchanting Gems and various other useful items as opposed to Enchanted Books, 
which are far too bountiful in the pack already. Makes for a really handy way to obtain the rarer gems like Lucky Citrine and Haste Peridot!

- Lowered Hasty Champion Affix's speed bonus to 1.5
- Enhabled Plagued and Desecration Affixes for Champions
- Reduced Plagued and Desecration's area of effect clouds to 0.5 and 1 from 4 and 5 respectively


= TO DO =
- Give Air Malachite Bow Curse of Vanishing upon Forging
- Make Quark Tome apply to Knight Jump


- Demo Spells and Shields and see if it's a fit for the pack (awesome mod!)
- Demo Open Parties and Claims for it's Xaero's World Map parity
