Welcome to the Stripped version of Resurvival. 
Many removals have been made here in an attempt to increase server performance. 
I'm not happy about em! I love basically every mod I add in, and am never happy to have to remove them.
But given some mods are completely hampering server performance, I owe it to myself and to the pack players to at least try and make the experience as smooth as possible.
That's what the Stripped version is all about.
Updates may pull even more mods and features out based on if they improve performance or not, so consider this an experimental series of updates.

- Removed Lava Monsters
- Removed Eyes in the Darkness
- Removed Biome Makeover
- Removed Open Parties and Claims
- Removed Immersive Weathering
- Removed Guard Villagers
- Removed Big Brain
- Removed Create
- Added YUNG's Better Desert Temples (Forge)

- Disabled Alex's Mobs Crows, Cockroaches, Racoons, Crocodiles and Flys to reduce server lag
- Disabled Artifact's Mimics due to reduce server lag
- Reduced Guard Villager's attack trigger range when Villagers are attacked from 50 to 25 to help reduce lag

- Added Alexish Mobs resource pack to allow Alex's Mobs and Naturalist to work alongside each other
- Re-enabled Grizzly Bear (now Black Bear)

= TO DO =
Make new server world to test out if this helps at all :sob:
