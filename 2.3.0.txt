= DONE =
Many removals have been made here in an attempt to increase server performance. 
I'm not happy about em! I love basically every mod I add in, and am never happy to have to remove them.
But given some mods are completely hampering server performance, I owe it to myself and to the pack players to at least try and make the experience as smooth as possible.
That's what the Stripped version is all about.
Updates may pull even more mods and features out based on if they improve performance or not, so consider this an experimental series of updates.

- Removed Eyes in the Darkness
- Removed Biome Makeover and Biome Makeover Makeover
- Removed Compat Makeover

- Removed the No Shield power from the Lushling Origin (I'd forgor)
- Lushlings currently no longer have a flower crown stuck to their head due to the removal of IW
- Disabled Alex's Mobs Crows, Cockroaches, Racoons, Crocodiles and Flys to reduce server lag
