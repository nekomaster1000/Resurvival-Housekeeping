- BETTER NETHER ORIGIN

- Disable a bunch of Grappling Hook Mod JEI entries.

- Credits Page

- VanillaTweaks integration

- Add Integrated Dungeons and Structures at some point (presumably after getting rid of the other lame worldgen stuff?)

Terralith structure loot tables either heavily edited or flat out removed, plus some biomes (ie yellowstone biome) should be removed cuz you can easily progress in some mods (tetra) very quickly with it, a terralith structure has fuckin end rods, VERY GOOD FOR TETRA TOOLS BTW

Hourglass - slow down how fast 1 player sleeping makes the night go by

JEI blacklisting? hello??
