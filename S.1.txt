= DONE =
- Removed Continents to improve chunk loading - If still not great, remove Darker Depths next

- Renamed Blazeborn to Cinderborn
- Cinderborn no longer spawn in the Nether (to prevent crashing), now spawning in the overworld
- Removed the Avian origin as it massively overlaps with the Cinderborn
- Xaero's Minimap now always points north like the world map for consistency between the two
- Rebound the minimap options to [, pairing with the worldmap options on ]
