More removals in the name of improving chunk loading:
- Removed Continents to improve chunk loading
- Removed Darker Depths to improve chunk loading

- Renamed Blazeborn to Cinderborn
- Cinderborn no longer spawn in the Nether (to prevent crashing), now spawning in the overworld
- Removed the Avian origin as it massively overlaps with the Cinderborn
- Xaero's Minimap now always points north like the world map for consistency between the two
