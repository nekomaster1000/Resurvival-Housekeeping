= DONE =

- Added info on Hotbar Switcher and Campfires in the How to Play quest, and mentioned Sitting on the Crawling checkmark

- Fixed Gapples still being craftable in a Crafting Table - They're now Gem Forge exclusive

= TO DO =
- remove architectury mods to avoid an invalid player data lock-out RAAA

- tweak MPR setups so only meated mobs have incrases base stats, feels too random as it is now
- clean up MPR schema
- Figure out something cool to do with levels in mcreator idk ;; Maybe give AET a 'prayer' functionality that randomly enchants a tool, at the cost of 30 whole levels and no garuntee of a good enchantment...?
