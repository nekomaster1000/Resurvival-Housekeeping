= DONE =
- Disabled Allurement's experimental linear level scaling due to insane power-creep in ReSomalia

= TO DO =
- Add Aesthetic Enchanting Table to disable the enchanting table (When it's out)
- Figure out something cool to do with levels in mcreator idk ;;
  - Maybe give AET a 'prayer' functionality that randomly enchants a tool, at the cost of 30 whole levels and no garuntee of a good enchantment...?
