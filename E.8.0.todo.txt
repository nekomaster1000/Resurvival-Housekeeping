= DONE =
- Added Aesthetic Enchanting Table, disabling Enchanting in Resurvival
- Removed Enhanced Celestials, since nobody liked the Blood Moon events
- Disabled Allurement's experimental linear level scaling due to insane power-creep in ReSomalia

= TO DO =
- Figure out something cool to do with levels in mcreator idk ;;
  - Maybe give AET a 'prayer' functionality that randomly enchants a tool, at the cost of 30 whole levels and no garuntee of a good enchantment...?
