= DONE =
- Added Aesthetic Enchanting Table, disabling the Enchanting Table in Resurvival - Enchanting Gems and enchanted loot now rule the world
- Removed Enhanced Celestials, since barely anybody who played on the server liked the Blood Moon events
- Disabled Allurement's experimental linear level scaling due to insane power-creep in ReSomalia (Waystones will now be the focus of XP-gathering)
- Updated Shield Expansion, adding Griefer Shields and compat with all other shields in the pack!

- Added Apathy, turning Easy mode into a meaningfully accessible, enjoyable experience as Casual Mode - All hostiles are now neutral!

- Added YMD's Custom Camera View (Only works in third person, but is great for taking screenshots or machinimas)
  - Arrow keys to move the camera position
  - F6 and F7 to zoom in and out respectively

- Patchouli won't work with me, so I'm adding in-game documentation via a new Quest category! 
- The Quest Book is now given to players upon first joining a world, but can be accessed anytime with the * key. Info included:

= TO DO =
- tweak MPR setups so only meated mobs have incrases base stats, feels too random as it is now
- Figure out something cool to do with levels in mcreator idk ;; Maybe give AET a 'prayer' functionality that randomly enchants a tool, at the cost of 30 whole levels and no garuntee of a good enchantment...?
