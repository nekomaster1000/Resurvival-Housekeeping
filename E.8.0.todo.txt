= DONE =
- Added Aesthetic Enchanting Table, disabling the Enchanting Table in Resurvival - Enchanting Gems and enchanted loot now rule the world

- Removed Enhanced Celestials, since barely anybody who played on the server liked the Blood Moon events

- Disabled Allurement's experimental linear level scaling due to insane power-creep in ReSomalia (Waystones will now be the focus of XP-gathering)

- Updated Shield Expansion, adding Griefer Shields and compat with all other shields in the pack!

- Added YMD's Custom Camera View (Only works in third person, but is great for taking screenshots or machinimas)
  - Arrow keys to move the camera position
  - F6 and F7 to zoom in and out respectively

- Patchouli won't work with me, so I'm adding in-game documentation via a new Quest category! 
- The Quest Book is now given to players upon first joining a world, but can be accessed anytime with the * key. Info included:
Controls
  - Zooming
  - Wall-Jumping
  - Carrying
  - Crawling
  - Auto-Walking
  - Dodge-Rolling
  - Waystones
Info
  - Iron Generation
  - Enchanting

  (to do: 
add info on the end portal and new ender eyes
add info on apotheotic affixes, bosses and affix customization
add info on the utility of climbing rope and grappling hooks)

- Greatly increased the cost to travel with Waystones
- Waystones can now only be renamed by their owner
- Villages will now almost always generate with a Waystone, while randomly-generated Waystones will be a lot rarer

- Placed my Golden Sands RP above Sully's Tweaks, fixing Sandstone's side texture looking pale
- Removed the enchanting table GUI with a resource pack


= TO DO =
- Figure out something cool to do with levels in mcreator idk ;;
  - Maybe give AET a 'prayer' functionality that randomly enchants a tool, at the cost of 30 whole levels and no garuntee of a good enchantment...?
