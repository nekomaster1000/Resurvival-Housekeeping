= DONE =
- Added a datapack function that gives you Regeneration while sleeping.
- Disabled the Protection enchantment via Allurement config as per request: https://github.com/nekomaster1000/Resurvival-Housekeeping/issues/2

= TO DO =
"Recipes: Being able to upgrade stone-> diamond tools the same way you upgrade wood to stone, tool in one slot and the amount of materials needed to upgrade in the other slots

Skeleton detection range should be a bit smaller, its very easy for multiple skeletons to be shooting you from multiple angles and it becomes annoying

Skeletons that shoot extremely fast could have less accuracy, maybe it could be random as to which ones are accurate and which ones aren't

Hurting any animal that's in a group of the same animals should make the entire herd run away from you (maybe some animals could defend themselves?)

More baby mobs (baby skeletons, wither skeletons ect.) because why not make it more of a pain than it is?

Enderian origin's ender pearl cooldown should be much longer (you can cross large distances with it easily, 10-20 second cooldown maybe?)

Terralith structure loot tables either heavily edited or flat out removed, plus some biomes (ie yellowstone biome) should be removed cuz you can easily progress in some mods (tetra) very quickly with it, a terralith structure has fuckin end rods, VERY GOOD FOR TETRA TOOLS BTW

Feline origin could be nerfed a bit, maybe some creepers could randomly spawn that aren't afraid of the origin (the player not other cats), it would still make them a threat but not as big of one"


JEI blacklisting? hello??
