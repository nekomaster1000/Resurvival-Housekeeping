= DONE =
- Added No Mob Farms
- Turned on Allurement's linear Level scaling - It now always takes 100XP to level up, rather than incrementally more XP the higher your level is. Right now, it takes 3 regular zombie kills to go up a level.
- Added Fixed Anvil Repair Cost - It now always costs 3 levels to use an Anvil to repair 30% of an items durability
- Removed End of Mending, replacing it with Truly Treasures - Mending is now a Wandering Trader exclusive buy
- Made certain mobs drop more experience:
  - Mobs with random potion effects drop x2 their normal XP
  - Mobs with common armour drop x2-6 XP, and rare armour x8-10 their normal XP
- Added Jumpy Boats

- Netherite Armour can now be directly crafted in the Gem Forge with a Fire Ruby, granting immediate Fire Protection V on each piece.
- Added numerous cool Supplementaries items to the Champions loot table
- Added Griefer Soldiers to the list of MobsPropertiesRandomness mobs that can spawn - Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to work, so Griefer Armour has been added to the Champions loot table too
- Made Champions a little rarer and drop less loot
- Fixed Artifacts catalysts tag being broken + Changed certain recipes due to NBT incompatbility
- Disabled Adaptable Champions, as there's no good counter to them if you only have melee weapons on you
- Disabled Rattlesnakes from Alex's Mobs, little cretins
- Made Potion Effect-carrying mobs only have their effect for 66 seconds, as a Creeper explosion's lingering cloud would buff you permanently
- Mobs can now spawn with the Poison effect.
- Retextured Pickarang (Quark) and Obsidian Skull (Artifacts)
