- MPR Changes:
  - Merged 'footsoldiers', 'strongestsoldiers' and 'modsoldiers' into 'soldiers'

  - Renamed 'bigcaveguys' mobs to 'pillars', since they're big like cave pillars
  - Soldiers now have a chance of holding a tool and shield when spawning
  - Soldiers now always spawn with boots and leggings, but not a garunteed chestplate and helmet
