- MPR
  - Merged 'footsoldiers', 'strongestsoldiers' and 'modsoldiers' into 'soldiers' 
  - Renamed 'meated' mobs to 'latched', since they're mobs who have had a mob latch onto their head
  - Renamed 'bigcaveguys' mobs to 'pillars', since they're big like cave pillars
  - Soldiers now have a chance of holding a tool and shield when spawning
  - Soldiers now always spawn with boots and leggings, but not a garunteed chestplate and helmet
  - Added Sentries: Non-humanoid Soldiers
  - Removed Big Boys: Pillars are enough
  - Only Humanoids can now be Deepling or Effective
